# Server_And_ML_Model_Connector
I have created an API using Flask, which is a micro web framework written in Python. The purpose of this API is to take input from a server, preprocess the text input, and then feed it into a CNN model for text classification. The output of the CNN model is then returned back to the server for further processing and display to the user.
