# Server_And_ML_Model_Connector
I have created an API using Flask, which is a micro web framework written in Python. The purpose of this API is to take input from a server, preprocess the text input, and then feed it into a CNN model for text classification. The output of the CNN model is then returned back to the server for further processing and display to the user.
The API works by receiving input from the server in the form of text data. Once the text input is received, the API preprocesses it by performing tasks such as tokenization, removing stop words, and converting words to lowercase. This preprocessing step is necessary to ensure that the text input is in a suitable format for the CNN model.

Once the text input has been preprocessed, it is fed into the CNN model, which extracts relevant features from the text data and classifies it into predefined categories. The API then returns the predicted classification of the text data back to the server, where it can be used for further processing or displayed to the user.

One of the main benefits of using an API for text classification is that it provides a standardized interface for interacting with the CNN model. This makes it easy to integrate the text classification functionality into other applications and systems.

Overall, the Flask API that I have created is a powerful tool for text classification that can be customized to suit a wide variety of text classification tasks. It provides a scalable and convenient way to predict the classification of text input and can be integrated with other applications and systems with ease.
